			<h4>Do what you love!</h4>
			<p>I've heard this advice for a very long time, but wasn't certain how to apply it to life and coding.  </p>

			<p>It helped me out a lot to ask people what they learned, and take a small step to see what they liked and disliked about programming and how to avoid some pitfalls.  The best way to learn in my opinion is just start coding.  Get a feel for what sparks your interest and learn more about it.</p>

			<h4>Take your time.</h4>
			<p>Take your time learning new languages, if you feel confident enough in one language to want to continue learning, then pick something that you are interested in.  If the technology has advanced before you get the chance to learn that language or coding technique, it's ok to keep on learning that until you feel good.</p>
			
            <h4>If you don't like something it's ok to feel differently than others.</h4>
			<p>Be bold and confident that you will feel differently than others in various topics within the world of coding.  It's encouraged and then you have the chance to talk about why you feel the way you do with even the simple things such as documenting where you got code, how it works, and eventually just making certain you have fun while doing it.</p>
